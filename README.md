 Keylogger-Detector-Anti-Keylogger-Tool
 
This is a small Python project that checks running processes on your system and tries to detect suspicious activity like keyloggers. It looks for common signs that keyloggers might leave behind

# What It Does
1 Scans active processes running on the system
2 Checks for known suspicious process names
3 Looks for programs that are recording keyboard input
4 Warns the user if something looks unsafe
  
# How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Install required libraries:
pip install psutil
3. Run the script:
python keylogger_detector.py
4. The program will scan your system and show results.

# Example Output
Scanning running processes.
 No known keylogger processes found.

Or if something suspicious is found:
 Warning: Suspicious process detected - "keylog.exe"
# Notes
1 This tool is basic and made for learning.
2 It doesn't remove or block malware â€” it just gives a warning.
3 You can improve it by updating the suspicious process list or using more advanced detection methods.
